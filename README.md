House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

Developed a machine learning model to predict house prices based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and other house attributes.

Key Highlights:

• Preprocessed data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

• Built and trained a Linear Regression model to predict house prices.

• Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.

• Visualized the relationship between actual and predicted prices for better insights.

• Deployed model to make accurate price predictions for new properties.
